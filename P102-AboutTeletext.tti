OL,5, In the United Kingdom, Teletext is a   
OL,6, nostalgic feature that used to be on   
OL,7, our TVs over a decade ago.             
OL,9, But internationally, Teletext (in this 
OL,10, form) is still very much in use!       
OL,12, Before the digital TV switchover in the
OL,13, UK (2007-2012), parts of the TV picture
OL,14, that were hidden off-screen were used  
OL,15, to transmit digital data in the form of
OL,16, light and dark dots, which the Teletext
OL,17, decoder on the TV could read/convert.  
OL,19, You would sometimes be able to see this
OL,20, when changing channels / when adjusting

OL,22, hidden lines into view (briefly).
