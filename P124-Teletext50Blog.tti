OL,5, Of course, what it did mean, as always,
OL,6, was that most of the kit I'd brought   
OL,7, remained in the bags and cases.        
OL,9, But that's OK. It's easy to get carried
OL,10, away with what youCcouldGbe doing. This
OL,11, time, I made a point of telling myself 
OL,12, that 1) my priority wasn't showing off 
OL,13, what a brilliant stream I could do,Cit 
OL,14,Cwas covering what was going on in front
OL,15,Cof me,Gand 2) whatever I do is enough. 
OL,17, If I'm watching a live stream from an  
OL,18, event,CI want to see the event.GAll of 
OL,19, it. I don't mind the long gaps. I don't
OL,20, mind the lack of slick. For me,Cit all 
OL,21,Cadds to the feeling of being there.

OL,5, I was in two minds about streaming the 
OL,6, first event, actually, because it was a
OL,7, screening. Would people really want to 
OL,8, watch while I pointed a camera at a    
OL,9, screen, like a bootlegger at a cinema? 
OL,11, But I'm really glad I kept the stream  
OL,12, rolling.CIt was a binge-showing of all

OL,16, teaching sign language to deaf viewers.
OL,18, And even though it was a video of a    
OL,19, video, it became a spontaneous watch   
OL,20, party, with Twitch viewers commenting  
OL,21, in chat about how incredible it was.
