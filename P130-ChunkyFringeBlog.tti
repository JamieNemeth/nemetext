OL,5, I honestly thought I'd lost my chance  
OL,6, to be involved with the teletext       
OL,7, community. A few years ago, I found a  
OL,8, random reference to a one-off teletext 
OL,9, get-together that had happened even    
OL,10, more years prior, where updates had    
OL,11, been beamed to a few venues using      
OL,12, TVs which had been adapted to receive  
OL,13, teletext via the internet.             
OL,15, "That's so cool," I thought, "I didn't 
OL,16, know you could even do that!"          
OL,18, And so began a journey down a rabbit   
OL,19, hole of nostalgia. There were VBITs and
OL,20, inserters and packet data andCteletext

OL,5,CI wanted in!GI grew up with teletext - 
OL,6, sort-of. You see, during my childhood, 
OL,7, we had a black-and-white TV for a long 
OL,8, time. The B&W TV licence was (and still
OL,9, is) significantly cheaper than its     
OL,10, colour counterpart, but I don't know of
OL,11, any B&W teletext TVs. Our family set   
OL,12, was a Rediffusion which had a converter
OL,13, box so that it could receive UHF TV.   
OL,14, Watching snooker was a challenge if the
OL,15, balls strayed too far from their usual 
OL,16, spots. I'd have to imagine what the    
OL,17, colours were supposed to be for several
OL,18, programmes - at least where it wasn't  
OL,19, obvious - based on glimpses of those   
OL,20, programmes on TVs in other people's    
OL,21, houses, or in shop windows.

OL,5,GOn the plus side, the lack of teletext 
OL,6, at home meant it never ever became run-
OL,7, of-the-mill. It, like colour TV, was a 
OL,8, source of excitement, a rare treat.    
OL,10, Naturally, Bamboozle was the first port
OL,11, of call. But I do have memories of the 
OL,12, world clock, and I definitely read     
OL,13, Digitiser at some point (merely because
OL,14, it sounded digital and technological). 
OL,16, This is what's weird, though. I don't  
OL,17, seem to have any specific memories of  
OL,18, it, unlike the people who turned up in 
OL,19, great numbers to see Digitiser Live for
OL,20, the 30th anniversary of the teletext   
OL,21, magazine. And that makes me sad.

OL,8, Mind you, even with all of the advance

OL,12, finding lovely places to stay, that she
OL,13,Gshould do it as a full-time gig. Our   
OL,14, accommodation was The Tudor Lodge Hotel
OL,15, in Pinner, a stone's throw from the    
OL,16, Harrow Arts Centre.                    
OL,18, I was anxious about the drive, as it   
OL,19,Gwould be my longest to date (mum can't

OL,21, weren't coming along). But I did it!

OL,5,GThe accommodation was lovely, and with 
OL,6, all of the mod-cons you needed whilst  
OL,7, staying sympathetic to the obviously-  
OL,8, historic building. We later discovered 
OL,9, that it had originally been built as a 
OL,10, World War I hospital for returning     
OL,11,Gsoldiers.                              
OL,13,GI spent a little bit of time adding a  
OL,14, few things to the streaming PC, but not
OL,15, too long. It was always going to be a  
OL,16, tradeoff between predicting every      
OL,17, eventuality, and getting enough sleep  
OL,18, to deal with things on the fly the next
OL,19,Gday. Too much of the former would have 
OL,20, led to diminishing returns for the

OL,5,GThe drive to Harrow Arts Centre the    
OL,6, next morning was smooth and short. But 
OL,7, it turned out to be the right call, not
OL,8, losing too much sleep over preparation.
OL,9, Everyone needed to wait for equipment

OL,5,GBefore I had much of a chance to talk

OL,7, open! I tried to set up as much as I

OL,5,GAsh had kindly offered us all sorts of

OL,5,GThe bane of any streamer is a poor     
OL,6, internet connection - and I was warned 
OL,7, it could be patchy, there - but this   
OL,8, was an unusual way for it to fail. At  
OL,9, times, it would be a stable 20 Mbps -  
OL,10, more than enough to stream stably, and 
OL,11,Git would, for about two minutes maximum
OL,12, before it flatlined to zero, and would 
OL,13, refuse to do anything for another five 
OL,14, minutes or so. I started making fine   
OL,15, adjustments to the antennae on my fancy
OL,16,GWiFi adapter as if they were the bunny-
OL,17,Gears on an analogue TV, thinking I was 
OL,18,Gon to something, but I wasn't really.  
OL,19,G                                       
OL,20, So I kicked back and enjoyed the show, 
OL,21, knowing I'd done all I could.COr had I?

OL,5,GAsh (from the Under Consoletation      
OL,6, podcast) first offered up his mobile   
OL,7, for a 5G tether, but his data rate was 
OL,8, even slower than mine. I was offered a 
OL,9, different phone to use, but there were 
OL,10, other issues I needed to sort (due to  
OL,11,Gfudging with settings), so myself and  
OL,12, mum took a break after the Teletext    
OL,13, Sofa Club to get a bite to eat.        
OL,15, And the organisers of Chunky Fringe    
OL,16,Gweren't lying about how close the venue
OL,17,Gwas to Morrisons! Their cafes close to 
OL,18,Ghome have all been fine, but this one? 
OL,19,GThe fish was enormous, and delicious,  
OL,20, so no complaints there. A much needed  
OL,21, recharge before we headed back.

OL,5,GWhat I hadn't realised, but mum had,   
OL,6, was that - whilst we also needed food -
OL,7, there were several people gathering to 
OL,8, try and plan a surprise element for the
OL,9, Digitiser Live show that evening. So it
OL,10, made sense to get out of earshot, out  
OL,11,Gof politeness.                         
OL,13, By this point, I asked Cliff Foster if 
OL,14, I could take him up on his offer of the
OL,15, reliable 5G unlimited data tether. And 
OL,16,Gwe got most of 'The 32X Factor' out to 
OL,17,Gthe wider world, before the gremlins   
OL,18,Gstruck again, and suddenly the WiFi was
OL,19,Gworking when the 5G had given up!
