OL,5,CI honestly thought I'd lost my chance  
OL,6,Cto be involved with the teletext       
OL,7,Ccommunity.GA few years ago, I found a  
OL,8, random reference to a one-off teletext 
OL,9, get-together that had happened even    
OL,10, more years prior, where updates had    
OL,11, been beamed to a few venues using      
OL,12, TVs which had been adapted to receive  
OL,13, teletext via the internet.             
OL,15, "That's so cool," I thought, "I didn't 
OL,16, know you could even do that!"          
OL,18, And so began a journey down a rabbit   
OL,19, hole of nostalgia. There were VBITs and
OL,20, inserters and packet data andCteletext

OL,5,CI wanted in!GI grew up with teletext - 
OL,6, sort-of. You see, during my childhood, 
OL,7, we had a black-and-white TV for a long 
OL,8, time. The B&W TV licence was (and still
OL,9, is) significantly cheaper than its     
OL,10, colour counterpart, but I don't know of
OL,11, any B&W teletext TVs. Our family set   
OL,12, was a Rediffusion which had a converter
OL,13, box so that it could receive UHF TV.   
OL,14, Watching snooker was a challenge if the
OL,15, balls strayed too far from their usual 
OL,16, spots. I'd have to imagine what the    
OL,17, colours were supposed to be for several
OL,18, programmes - at least where it wasn't  
OL,19, obvious - based on glimpses of those   
OL,20, programmes on TVs in other people's    
OL,21, houses, or in shop windows.

OL,5,GOn the plus side, the lack of teletext 
OL,6, at home meant it never ever became run-
OL,7, of-the-mill. It, like colour TV, was a 
OL,8, source of excitement, a rare treat.    
OL,10, Naturally, Bamboozle was the first port
OL,11, of call. But I do have memories of the 
OL,12, world clock, and I definitely read     
OL,13, Digitiser at some point (merely because
OL,14, it sounded digital and technological). 
OL,16, This is what's weird, though. I don't  
OL,17, seem to have any specific memories of  
OL,18, it, unlike the people who turned up in 
OL,19, great numbers to see Digitiser Live for
OL,20, the 30th anniversary of the teletext   
OL,21, magazine. And that makes me sad.

OL,8, Mind you, even with all of the advance

OL,11,GI keep saying that mum is so good at   
OL,12, finding lovely places to stay, that she
OL,13,Gshould do it as a full-time gig. Our   
OL,14, accommodation was The Tudor Lodge Hotel
OL,15, in Pinner, a stone's throw from the    
OL,16, Harrow Arts Centre.                    
OL,18, I was anxious about the drive, as it   
OL,19,Gwould be my longest to date (mum can't 
OL,20, drive; my dad and sister can, but they 
OL,21, weren't coming along). But I did it!

OL,5,GThe accommodation was lovely, and with 
OL,6, all of the mod-cons you needed whilst  
OL,7, staying sympathetic to the obviously-  
OL,8, historic building. We later discovered 
OL,9, that it had originally been built as a 
OL,10, World War I hospital for returning     
OL,11,Gsoldiers.                              
OL,13,GI spent a little bit of time adding a  
OL,14, few things to the streaming PC, but not
OL,15, too long. It was always going to be a  
OL,16, tradeoff between predicting every      
OL,17, eventuality, and getting enough sleep  
OL,18, to deal with things on the fly the next
OL,19,Gday. Too much of the former would have 
OL,20, led to diminishing returns for the

OL,5,GThe drive to Harrow Arts Centre the    
OL,6, next morning was smooth and short. But 
OL,7, it turned out to be the right call, not
OL,8, losing too much sleep over preparation.
OL,9, Everyone needed to wait for equipment

OL,13,GAnd those of us who were aiming to set

OL,5,GBefore I had much of a chance to talk  
OL,6, to anyone else, the Boiler House was   
OL,7, open! I tried to set up as much as I

OL,5,GAsh had kindly offered us all sorts of

OL,5,GThe bane of any streamer is a poor     
OL,6, internet connection - and I was warned 
OL,7, it could be patchy, there - but this   
OL,8, was an unusual way for it to fail. At  
OL,9, times, it would be a stable 20 Mbps -  
OL,10, more than enough to stream stably, and 
OL,11,Git would, for about two minutes maximum
OL,12, before it flatlined to zero, and would 
OL,13, refuse to do anything for another five 
OL,14, minutes or so. I started making fine

OL,7, there were several people gathering to

OL,6, left the Boiler House, I decided to go 
OL,7, for it. One last hurrah. A quick piece 
OL,8, to camera about how the day had gone,  
OL,9, which attracted the attention of the

OL,11, into an amazing interview, interrupted

OL,5, The success of that interview - with   
OL,6, Carl, Cliff, Nathan, and an appearance 
OL,7, of David with an illuminated bin -     
OL,8, spurred me on to do another interview  
OL,9, with Peter Kwan, using my brand-new    
OL,10, wireless lapel mics.                   
OL,12, My brand-new,CuntestedGwireless lapel  
OL,13, mics. I'm sure you can see where this  
OL,14, is heading. Or maybe not quite.        
OL,16, First, I began the interview by calling
OL,17, him Alistair Cree...to which Peter, who
OL,18, I KNEW was Peter, extremely politely   
OL,19, and gently corrected me.               
OL,21, Actual Alistair was mere feet away!

OL,5, But the conversation with Peter - this

OL,7, to strength, winding through so much   
OL,8, history and nostalgia, which would've  
OL,9, made for a truly fascinating listen, if
OL,10, the microphones had been switched on...
OL,12, I think they must have run out of      
OL,13, charge, as one of the things that fell 
OL,14, by the wayside earlier on in the day   
OL,15, was me setting up a charging station   
OL,16, for myself. I just didn't have the free
OL,17, time or the free hands. And so I must  
OL,18, have picked the mic set with the least

OL,5, I whizzed back and fore to the car with

OL,6, building up to the evening show.       
OL,8, Some were in the backstage theatre bar,

OL,11, cans of beer in hand, groups of people
