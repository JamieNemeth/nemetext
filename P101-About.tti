OL,5, Nemetext is a Teletext service which   
OL,6, accompanies Jamie Nemeth's Twitch      
OL,7, channel/streams.                       
OL,9, It all began when Jamie stumbled upon  
OL,10, @ZXGuesser's brilliant online Teletext 
OL,11, viewer, and that led to a rabbit hole  
OL,12, of recovered Teletext pages from VHS,  
OL,13, as well as the discovery of brand-new  
OL,14, Teletext services (e.g. Teefax and     
OL,15, NMS Ceefax), created by enthusiasts,   
OL,16, some of whom had been engineers on the 
OL,17, original Teletext services in the UK.  
OL,19, Jamie knew he wasn't the first streamer
OL,20, to make a new Teletext service, but he 
OL,21, may be the first one to make a service 
OL,22, specifically for their Twitch channel!
